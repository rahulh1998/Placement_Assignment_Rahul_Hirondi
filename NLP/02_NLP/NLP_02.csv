aims
to
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
heart
disease
prediction
analysis
technique.
It
will
outline
the
necessary
steps
that
must
be 
followed
prior
to
conducting
any
analysis.
Additionally ,
the
document
will 
elucidate
the
algorithms
and
techniques
employed
to
predict
the
presence
or 
absence
of
heart
disease,
accompanied
by
a
comparative
analysis
of
the 
results.
It
will
also
encompass
low-level

The
low-level
design
(LLD)
documentation
provides
a
comprehensive
representation
of
the
internal
structure
of
the
heart
disease
prediction
system,
outlining
the
individual
components
and
their
interactions.
The
purpose
of
LLD
is
to
offer
a
detailed
logical
design
of
the
actual
program
code.
This
design
is
derived
from
the
high-level
design.
The
LLD
documentation
includes
a
thorough
description
of
the
employed
model,
including
comparisons
between
the
proposed
model
or
library
and
an
existing
baseline
model,
based
on
a
set
of
predefined
metrics.P r o j e c t
I n t r o d u c t i o n
In
today's
world,
heart
disease
(HD)
is
a
prevalent
ailment,
and
early 
detection
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
efforts
of
healthcare
providers
to 
safeguard
their
patients
and
save
lives..
The
healthcare
industry
gathers
vast
amounts
of
data
that
contain
valuable
hidden
insights,
which
can
aid
in
making
informed
decisions.
To
derive 
meaningful
results
and
facilitate
effective
decision-making,
the
application 
of
data
science
techniques
becomes
essential.
Data
analysis
techniques 
can
predict
the
probability
of
individuals
developing
heart
disease,
thereby 
facilitating
the
establishment
of
significant
knowledge,
such
as
identifying 
relationships
between
medical
factors
associated
with
heart
disease
and 
recognizing
patterns.
The
results
obtained
from
such
analyses
have 
demonstrated
the
effectiveness
of
the
designed
diagnostic
system
in 
accurately
predicting
the
risk
level
of
heart
diseases.
C o n s t r a i n t s
The
analysis
conducted
utilizes
a
restricted
dataset
focusing
on
14
specific 
features
known
to
impact
heart
disease.
It's
important
to
note
that
external 
interventions,
such
as
underlying
diseases,
medication
types,
lifestyle 
patterns,
and
BMI
values,
are
not
considered
in
this
analysis.
These
factors 
have
the
potential
to
influence
the
occurrence
and
progression
of
heart 
disease.
While
the
analysis
provides
insights
based
on
the
available
dataset, 
it's
crucial
to
acknowledge
that
a
more
comprehensive
approach 
incorporating
these
external
interventions
would
be
necessary
for
a
more 
accurate
assessment
and
prediction
of
heart
disease.

In
the
midst
of
the
pandemic,
we
have
collectively
recognized
the
significant
impact
of
COVID-19
on
people
from
all
walks
of
life,
regardless
of
their
social
or
economic
status.
In
order
to
enhance
future
preparedness,
it
is
essential
to
analyze
health
and
medical
data
related
to
this
crisis.
A
dataset
has
been
compiled,
comprising
information
from
303
individuals,
with
the
aim
of
gaining
valuable
insights
and
informing
strategies
for
better
preparation
in
the

Data
Pre-Processing
Before
building
any
model,
it
is
crucial
to
perform
data
pre-processing
to
feed
the
correct
data
to
the
model
to
learn
and
predict.
Model
performance
depends
on
the
quality
of
data
feeded
to
the
model
to
train.
This
Process
includes
a)
Handling
Null/Missing
Values
b)
Handling
Skewed
Data
c)
Outliers
Detection
and
Removal

Cleaning
Data
cleaning
is
the
process
of
fixing
or
removing
incorrect,
corrupted,
incorrectly
formatted,
duplicate,
or
incomplete
data
within
a
dataset.
a)
Remove
duplicate
or
irrelevant
observations
b)
Filter
unwanted
outliers
c)
Renaming

Exploratory
Data
Analysis
(EDA)
Exploratory
Data
Analysis
refers
to
the
critical
process
of
performing
initial
investigations
on
data
to
discover
patterns,
spot
anomalies,
test
hypothesis
and
to
check
assumptions
with
the
help
of
summary
statistics
and
graphical
representations.

Reporting
Reporting
is
a
most
important
and
underrated
skill
of
a
data
analytics
field.
Because
being
a
Data
Analyst
you
should
be
good
in
easy
and
selfexplanatory
report
because
your
model
will
be
used
by
many
stakeholders
who
are
not
from
a
technical
background.

Modeling
Data
Modelling
is
the
process
of
analyzing
the
data
objects
and
their
relationship
to
the
other
objects.
It
is
used
to
analyze
the
data
requirements
that
are
required
for
the
business
processes.
The
data
models
are
created
for
the
data
to
be
stored
in
a
database.
The
Data
Model's
main
focus
is
on
what
data
is
needed
and
how
we
have
to
organize
data
rather
than
what
operations
we
have
to
perform.
